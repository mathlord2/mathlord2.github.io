    <p>COV-AID is a web application that helps doctors diagnose COVID-19 in their patients via machine learning and send diagnostic data to them in a streamlined way.
      User sign in with their Google/email account via Firebase. After a doctor logs in, they can upload an image of a patient's chest x-ray and send it to the Node.js
      backend server, where a Keras ML model analyzes it and checks if the patient is tested positive or negative. This data then gets send to the patient, who can access
      it via their own account, and is stored on Firebase Firestore. This project got an honourable mention for the Google Cloud Prize.

      <b>Project Highlight (WinHacks 2020) - COV-AID</b>
    </div>
    <p>COV-AID is a web application that greatly improves the process of receiving financial aid during the COVID-19 crisis with blockchain technology.
      After a user logs in with Metamask, they can submit an image of their government ID, which is analyzed with Google Cloud's Vision API and a Javascript algorithm,
      and the output is sent to an express.js and MongoDB backend server through IPFS to determine if the user is eligible for financial aid. If eligible, Metamask and
      our smart contracts will prompt the transaction in the blockchain, making the process very secure and efficient. Our project won WinHacks' Most Innovative Hack
      against COVID-19 Award ($1000 CAD prize).

      <b>ETHDenver 2020 - TornadoCatch</b>
    </div>
    <p>TornadoCatch is a DApp that raises awareness for network-level privacy issues on Ethereum. It uses a Node.js
      catcher server to obtain data - wifi data through tshark and
      on-chain data via web3.js - and matches these activities to allow for the de-anonymization of DApp users; our app
      specifically de-anonymizes users of the cryptocurrency trading tool Tornado.cash.
      This data is then saved on a JSON file and sent to a Chrome extension to display the links of the data (MAC address,
      time, hash, URL).

      <b>ETHWaterloo 2019 - Blocktalk</b>
    </div>
    <p>Blocktalk is a messaging web application that uses the IPFS protocol to encrypt user messages and store their
      hashes in a blockchain.
      This is then decrypted and the information is sent through JSON for the frontend to access it. We used Fortmatic's
      login API to implement
      an authentication process for the app and create an email address for other users to contact. Our project won
      Fortmatic's 250 CAD (190 DAI) prize.

    <p>Easymoji is a Tkinter app that uses the webcam to capture a picture of your face and find an emoji that best
    suits your facial expression. We used OpenCV for the webcam access and the face capturing, and the API we used to
    determine the emotions is Microsoft Azure's Face API.</p>
