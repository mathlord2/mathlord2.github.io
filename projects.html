      <b>JAMHacks 2 - Kinetic Alpha</b>
    </div>
    <p>JAMHacks 2 was my first hackathon that I have ever attended, which was hosted by my own high school. Our team of 4 created a new tab extension which provides a variety of uses, including the date, links to educational services, and a Google Search Bar. The changing backgrounds always supply a fresh look for the new tab.</p>

      <b>StarterHacks - Byte-Mail</b>
    </div>
    <p>At StarterHacks 2019, hosted by the University of Waterloo, our team of 5 created a secure mailing platform. It allows the sender's email to be encrypted using a blockchain-inspired algorithm and sent anonymously to the receiver, without anyone being able to hack into the message and figure out its sender or recipient.</p>

      <b>MasseyHacks V - Spent</b>
    </div>
    <p>At MasseyHacks V in Windsor, our team of 4 created a web application called Spent. This Firebase app allows you to track your expenses over a specific time period (e.g. 1 week, 1 month, etc.) and visualize how much you went over/below your budget.</p>

      <b>JAMHacks 3 - OfflineAssist</b>
    </div>
    <p>At JAMHacks 3, our team of 4 created OfflineAssist, an offline Google-services provider, with the main service being Google Assistant. Our entire program is run using a Linode server, and the user sends an SMS to a Twilio number, which sends and receives requests from the Google APIs. Our team won 2nd place.</p>

      <b>CS Club Project - Orderly Lifestyle</b>
    </div>
    <p>For our final project for the SJAM CS Club, our team of 4 created Orderly Lifestyle, a modernized to-do list. All the tasks are neatly organized one on-top of each other and you can customize each task to include extra information. You can delete a task by simply clicking the circle icon on the left.</p>

      <b>Summer Project - Bibyou</b>
    </div>
    <p>Bibyou is my first ever web application coded solely by myself using Firebase, Google App Engine, and Cloud Datastore. It allows you to track the sources for all of your assignments and it can help automatically cite sources in MLA, APA, or Chicago 17th Edition for you. By a click of a button, you can also edit the sources yourself if you see any mistakes.</p>
